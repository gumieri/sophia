# Sophia

This name comes from the ancient Greek (σοφίᾱ) and means wisdom, knowledge.
But even important, that name is beautiful.

My motivations to start this project came from the desire to organize properly
and easily find my digital books. Imagine a guy undecided whether to create a
directory by genre or author, if the author's surname should came before ...
whether it would be better to follow some standard academic ... You may have
understood that I have a problem, but come on.

The Git is incredible, I realy like how it works and how we use (CLI) it.
So I decided to make a way to organize my files (why only books?) in the same
way who Git track files. Of course not controlling versions, git already does
this very well. Sophia consists in add files to an index and mark them with tags
for when you request to the lovely librarian Sophia for 'medieval fantasy
books", she can give you a list of your catalog and it is easy to identify where
these files are.
